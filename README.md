<hr>

- Fetch API is a newer standard for dealing with HTTP requests
- The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses. It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.
- It is now a part of window object
- Fetch returns promises. 
- When you get a response from a promise, you have to use .then()
- If there is some kind of error, then we can do .catch()

## Update to the project
- In app.js, arrow functions are used.
- Arrow functions use lexical this. So you don't have to worry about the scope of the function
